# 2019-Happiness-data-analysis
This project presents the process to analyze data from countries all around the world to find patterns that explain the happiness of the people using three datasets:
1. '2019'
2. 'Country'
3. 'metadata'.
The first contains data from the 2019 happiness index covering the following variables: freedom to make life choices, GDP per capita, Social Support, healthy life expectancy, generosity, and perceptions of corruptions, the 'Country' dataset contains the total GDP for each country and region of the world from 1961 to 2023, and finally, The 'metadata' contains general information from all the countries in the Country dataset, including the income group, geographic region, and country code.

A data cleaning process was necessary in 'metadata' and 'Country' to delete regions rows that cannot be used in the analysis also as rows with many null values, and lastly, the data pivoting to perform line plots.
